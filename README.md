# CussCensor
A browser extension with the set purpose of censoring swear words with four different censor options!

For this project, I had the goal of building a chrome extension that would read the words on any given webpage as it is loaded and censor any cuss words from a set list in compliance with the users censor preferences. To accomplish this, I had to learn and successfully implement crucial chrome extension API (such as local storage) on top of my HTML, javascript and CSS.

The chrome extensions function is simple and has an easy to understand interface. The user can simply select a censor option from a list of four (Partial Censor, Full Censor, Replace and Disable), and the extension will automatically read through each page that is loaded while the extension is activated and commit the appropriate action on each cuss word encountered.
